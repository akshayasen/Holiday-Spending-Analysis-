# Holiday-Spending-Analysis- 

Project Description
The Holiday Spending Analysis project is a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze seasonal sales trends, supplier performance, and product dynamics during high-demand holiday periods. The dashboard is divided into two interactive pages, offering actionable insights for businesses to optimize their supply chain, marketing, and inventory strategies:

Page 1: Season's Spending: A Holiday Sales Journey

Focuses on overall sales trends, including retail and warehouse dynamics, item type performance, and peak sales periods.
Key insights include item types with the highest sales, monthly retail performance, and item-category-specific contributions.

Page 2: Santa's Helpers: Supplier Performance

Highlights supplier contributions to sales and item availability, along with a comparative analysis of warehouse vs. retail performance.
Provides details on supplier efficiency, item diversity, and top-selling item categories.
With interactive visuals, slicers, and navigation buttons, this dashboard empowers users to explore the data dynamically and uncover meaningful patterns in holiday spending.
